I was thinking about a tool where I can go from visual to text and vice versa really fast. And from any point in an idea, I should be able to branch off quickly. Any kind of explorations cannot be slow drawing in that case, it should be quick. Thats what I did with ThinkLoops with AI. This is an AI aided quick thinking tool. I'm always thinking how to get our explorations few levels up, and I guess this would be a starting point. I would be researching and trying to experiment in this space with this tool, if you think this is cool, join the journey I guess!
